How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    By printing both versions adjacent to each other.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

    Since you can access to all changes you have done to a file.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?

    Most commits will be meaningful, but user error might occur.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Because in many instances while coding, two or more files are directly related to each other.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

	Use git log to view changes and notes about the change. Use git diff to view differences between two commit IDs.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?

	By checking carefully between each commit.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

	To be able to take risks while not harming my working code.
