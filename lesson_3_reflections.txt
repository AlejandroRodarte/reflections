When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

    When I desire for other people to provide me feedback on my projects.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	Since usually features require a lot of commits, so pulling per commit would not be benefitial.
