When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

    When I desire for other people to provide me feedback on my projects.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	Since usually features require a lot of commits, so pulling per commit would not be benefitial.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

	Forks is cloning directly another person's Github repository into my own repository.
	Clone is copying a local repository of another persons's Github repository.
	Branches is creating a new path of the project.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

	To be able to resolve conflicts.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

	Having a big database where everyone fucking copies and pastes their versions.
